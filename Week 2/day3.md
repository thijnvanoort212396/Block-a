## How to tell if something is a human or a machine.
2.2A A robot wont be able to solve a logical paradox "This sentence is false" which implies the sentence is correct which makes it false. And most chatbots give a random response so ask them some bogus and see if they respond normaly. And you could ask him how he come up with awnsers.

Problem is in the future Machine will find a way of manipulation which we dont understand. For example the idea in Life 3.0. When humans where just advanced monkeys elphants could not concive of how in the future humans would use metal bullets and guns and posion them to defeat them.
