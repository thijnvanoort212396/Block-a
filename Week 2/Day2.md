## **What is data, information and knowledge?**

**1C** two examples
|A. Example|B. Data|C. Information|D. Knowledge|E. Wisdom|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---|
|Rain|It is raining|Clouds release water dropplets that fall to the earth |Because a cloud gets low eneugh that is not at the freezing point it will start to produce water droplets which due to gravity will fal to earth|Because rain always follows the same patterns we can predict based on data when it could rain and how much|
|Traffic|People are driving|People need to go places and take the car to go there|Because to many people want to go from A to B the infrastructure cant handel it and will result in traffc|We can predict when traffic wil be at it worst because humans are habit animals and then find a solution to fix that traffic(which is not build more lanes beccause induced demand)|

## 2) **Data analysis methods**
**2E + notes**

**What is descriptive  Analytics?**

    Cleaning up of the data and making relations between data and summarize it and vizualize it so that others can have insight. Anytime when you are describing your business and you use the former steps to reach it.

    Example: You get raw Data from a groccery store and you first clean up the data so that the outliers and non sensical data gets removed. Then you try and make correlations with them to describe what is going on.


 **What is a Diagnostic Analytics?**
****    
    Using Data mining and discovery and finding the correlatin between data but making sure you use the right causation becase correlation does not mean causation. Why are things happening? why is this going up or why is this going down.

    Example: Now lets say get data that has been cleaned up and made ready for use, you can now take that data from example a groccery store and find correlations and see why sales are going up or down.

**What is Predictive Analytics?**
****
    Building models and refine them so that they can be used in a business envoirment and it is used to predict for example sales and what will happen.

    Example: Now that we know what is happening and why, we can start making predictions on when certain products will be sold the most.

**What is Prescriptive Analytics?**
****
    This is used for supplementing your model and integrating in a business and using vizalization so that others can read it more cleary.

    Example: Now that we know what is happening and why and what will probaly happen in the future, it is now time to put that knowledge into practice. By using the data we can visualize it and make it so that a business can adopt it. 

**2F** Power BI is one of the most popular dashboarding tools. List another dashboarding tool, and provide at least one ‘strength' and ‘weakness'. Write your answer down.

Workotter: This program is eazy to use by using a widget format dashboard so you can mix and match almost anything you want. By being limited to widgets you cant use other formats to display the data in your dashboard.

Nifty: You can use their portfolio tool which can be used to group clients. The homescreen gives insight into the whole project including tasks and milestones. However this is one of the more expensive software side and seems to be very slow and not giving previews instead it procceses everything.
