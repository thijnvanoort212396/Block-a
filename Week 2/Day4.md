# Taxonomy of AI

## supervised VS unsupervised learning

**Supervised learning** Is when you have a database with classifications. For example an image recognition software is trained to see cats and dogs, then you can label the cat images as cat and dog images as dogs. There is also regression which is takes in data and makes an equation that gives different factos diffrent weight factor to come to its awnser. For example a hotel site like booking.com could look at days before depature, stay, and other information to make the price as proffitable as possible that the customer is willing to pay.

**Unsupervised learning** This is when you dont label information and cluster information and find paterns we might not have tought of before. For example youtube can cluster people with similair interests and give them videos that they might like based on others with similair interests. This can work well because we humans are habit animals and if we do one thing we probaly will do another thing uncontinuously which can be predicted by clustering or finding not yet found paterns.

## Symbolic  Ai

**1d** Define the terms ‘inference', and ‘expert system' (Be concise!).

**Inference** means that an algorithm applies logical rules to the knowledge base.

**Expert system** is a system that is designed to solve complex problems and gives information to a human expert that then can make a more informed decision. This is done by extrating knowledge from its database and then reason an anwser.

**1e** Are artificial neural networks (ANNs) similar to the human brain? Support your answer with arguments.

ANN is a subfield in AI that is modeld after the brain, So yes it is similar to the human brain because the human brain was the objective to be build. It does this by simulating neurons interconnected which makes the ANN. The name is even derived from biologica neural networks.

**1f** An ANN uses a a) symbolic or b) connectionist approach to AI? Select one of the options, and explain your choice.

ANN use a connectionist approach to AI because it has neurons that are interconnected and connect to one and another to generate output see image for example.

**1g** Can you think of a real-life scenario where an AI method that uses a symbolic approach would be more suited than a method that uses a connectionist approach? Explain your answer.

You could use the symbolic approach for apple classification, you can say something about the size of the apple and the color and the shape of th Apple.
