*Performance measures, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors.*

**Specifying the task environment:**

    Performance measure: Wining the game of chess
    Environment: Fully obseravble and predictable
    Actuators: Deep blue and Gary Kasparov
    Sensors: Sight of chess board or input by human

**Properties of the task environment:**

    1) Fully observable, This is because all the posiable actions that can happen during the game are there and everything that can be accesed and used can be seen.
    2) Deterministic, All actions go towards the goal of wining and there are no random elements.
    3) sequential, Every player does their turn and so forth untill the goal of one player is reached or a tie.
    4) Dynamic, The oponent and you change the dynamicof the game.
    5) continuous, a sequence of actions untill the goal of winining has been reached
    6) Single agent, This is used because there is only one agent making decision
    7)
