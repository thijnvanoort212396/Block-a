# day 2
**goals for today**
1. List, and describe key moments in the history of AI
2.  Explain the procedure, and main objective of Turing's ‘Imitation Game'
3. Implement version control using ‘GitHub Desktop,' a Graphical User Interface for GitHub

**1.1C** In the book Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark i found a rather interesting picture seeing how the book is from 2017
and shows the following image

This image by Hans moravec reprisents what he tought and at that time was able to be achieved by an AI an with recetnly Dall-E has released which is an AI that can make art. Which makes the milestone of art reached even thought it hasnt been a year it still is history.

**1.2B**Besides the Turing Test, Alan Turing is renowned for his work on:
1. breaking german enigma code using an early version of a computer
   
2. Creating the definitive example of the unsolvable problem in computing that disproves Hilberts Entscheidungproblem
   
3. Laying the foundation for computer technologie and AI
   
**1.2** Turing test can machines think?

There are a few goals to the imitation game but it mostly comes down to can a machine act like a human. It does this by asking the following questions:
* can machines think
* can machines be conscious
* can machines fall in love
* can machines create art, masic poetry?(Awnser is yes)
* Can machines enjoy a delicious meal?

Trying to test this hypothesis Turing came up with a test where you test if humans can distinguish a human from a machine.
