| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
|*Eazy to produce.<br>*doesn't require machine learning or ai     |*Can only reply to written dow replies<br>*has only limted capabilty to awnser qeuston because it can only grab from its database.       |
  * retrieval-based:This form of chatbots use Machine learning models such as NLP to make conversation.

  | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
|*Can awnser more qeustions than rule based.<br>*Given eneugh data it can reply to almost everything and also procceses more then words like grammer     |*Takes more storage and energy<br>*Cant awnser qeustions by combining information.    |
  * generative: The mostly of all 3 to pass the Turing test, Generative chatbots arae able to formulate their own response based on what is being asked.
