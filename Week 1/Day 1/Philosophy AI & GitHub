2.1 Done
2.1B How would you define ‘artificial intelligence'?//
A non living object that can store knowledge and use the knowledge to apply it in situations.
2.1C 
1. Google assistance on a google home, this uses AI for recognizing language and finding a result that fits my question.
2. Using AI for looking at medical records or images it can make diagnosis that sometimes are more accurate than human diagnosis due to biases or human mistake.
3. A Swiss town near where I go every year uses an Radar together with a deep learning algorithm to detect if it is safe to cross a road or that there is danger of falling rocks(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-oVXYkBwgw&t=46s)

2.2 to be made
2.2a Reading …
2.2B Strong and Weak AI
Strong AI can be refereed to being “consciousness” But it feels more like AGI(Artificial general intelligence). This strong/AGI AI can overcome a lot of obstacles and is not focused on solving one issue. Weak AI on the other hand or Narrow AI is weaker in the sense that it is made to do one task and wont  be able to do anything else, for example an image recognition soft where that can see if there is a cat in an image, this Narrow AI wont be able to recognize anything else than a cat.
2.2C no
2.2D What is the ‘Chinese room experiment'? Describe its procedure.
This experiment is when you put a non Chinese speaker in a room and give them a Chinese sentence and an “algorithm” or more easily a step by step guide what to do, if you see this than do that just like how a machine would execute code. Because it is just following instructions you could say that it isnt thinking. I also believe this is what happened when an AI in google called LAMBA was released to be sentient. It is morelikly that this AI repeats information it has learned so if you where to ask it if it was not sentient the AI would awnser that it isn't sentient.
