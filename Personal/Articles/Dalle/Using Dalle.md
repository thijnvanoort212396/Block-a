  *image from Dall-e 2.0 using the phrase "Oil painting of a pond with frogs and a small bridge"* 

  Lets start with what is Dall-e 2.0? it is a program develloped by OpenAI and uses NLP to recognize the desired outcome and combines that with images.The program can genrate anything you want from ultra realistic futuristic cities to oil paintings of a small pond with a bridge. You can use Dall-E 2.0 yourself by singing up to their [site](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

  Now that we know that AI can generate these images we can ask ourselfs if this will have an impact on the art world. Using Dall-E 2.0 we are able to make our imagination into an image but it can only make an image based on things that have been created in the past. This means that the AI is not able to come up with new creative ideas or have own toughts that it can express in the image.

  Dall-E 2.0 can be used as a tool to make art or images to show concepts but it will as of now not be able to replace human artist because it cant come up with new concepts.
